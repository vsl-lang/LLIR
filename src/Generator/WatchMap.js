 * Manages state for handling watch behavior. You want to subclass this and

 * This handles navigation for moving on the graph.
 *
 * When you visit a node, it is compiled. Originally the primary node is
 * compiled but you could implement lazy compilation for navigation for JIT
 * for example.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * This begins at the graph's first position (node). This will call
 * {@link Node#notify} when applicable _before_ the return of the graph.
 *
 * You'll want an engine to manage returning of partially compilied objects.
